Detailed explanation (step-by-step)
===================================

Nice clear script — it injects a chat/widget **iframe** into the host page and coordinates size/style/behavior by listening for `postMessage` events from that iframe. I’ll walk through it top-to-bottom and then call out a few bugs/edge-cases and suggested fixes.

* * *

Top-level setup
---------------

```js
const scriptName = "loaderScript.js";
let height = window.innerHeight;
let width = window.innerWidth;
```

*   `scriptName` is used later to figure out the script’s origin (the folder/url that served the script).
*   `height` and `width` start as the current window viewport size and are kept updated on resize.

* * *

IIFE — runs immediately
-----------------------

```js
(() => { /* ... */ })();
```

*   Everything runs inside an Immediately Invoked Function Expression, so variables are scoped and the widget is set up as soon as this file executes.

* * *

Identify the `<script>` element and the page origin/url
-------------------------------------------------------

```js
const script = document.currentScript;
const url = window.location !== window.parent.location ? document.referrer : document.location;
```

*   `document.currentScript` references the `<script src="...loaderScript.js?...">` element that loaded this code.
*   `url` attempts to pick the “page URL” to send to the iframe:
    *   If the current page is inside another frame (it compares `window.location` and `window.parent.location`), it uses `document.referrer`.
    *   Otherwise it uses `document.location`.
    *   **Intent:** pass the host page URL to the widget so it knows where it’s embedded.

* * *

`loadWidget()` — builds and injects the iframe
----------------------------------------------

`loadWidget` is the main function. Key steps inside it:

1.  **Creates a `div` called `widget`:**
    ```js
    const widget = document.createElement("div");
    const widgetStyle = widget.style;
    widgetStyle.display = "none";
    widgetStyle.boxSizing = "border-box";
    widgetStyle.height = "650px";
    widgetStyle.position = "absolute";
    widgetStyle.bottom = "0";
    widgetStyle.right = "30px";
    ```
    *   This `div` is styled but **never appended** to the document — so in the current code it does nothing.
2.  **Creates the `iframe` element and styles it:**
    ```js
    const iframe = document.createElement("iframe");
    iframe.setAttribute("id", "meetusvr-chat-widget");
    const iframeStyle = iframe.style;
    iframeStyle.boxSizing = "borderBox";        // (typo; should be "border-box")
    iframeStyle.position = "fixed";
    iframeStyle.right = 0;                      // 0 is accepted by CSS, but "0px" is clearer
    iframeStyle.bottom = 0;
    iframeStyle.width = "320px";
    iframeStyle.height = "160px";
    iframeStyle.border = 0;
    iframeStyle.margin = 0;
    iframeStyle.padding = 0;
    iframeStyle.zIndex = 999999;
    ```
    *   The `iframe` is set up to sit fixed in the lower-right corner of the viewport with a high `z-index`.
    *   Note: `iframeStyle.display` is **not** set to `"none"` initially here (so it might briefly render before the `load` event). Later code hides it when invalid org or shows it on `load`.
3.  **Defines `messageTypes` constants** — a small enum of message types exchanged with the iframe (e.g. `init`, `dimensions`, `org`, `setParentStyle`, `floatingWidgetStyle`, etc.). These are used inside the message handler.
4.  **Derives `originUrl` from the script `src`:**
    ```js
    const originUrl = script.getAttribute("src").split(scriptName)[0];
    ```
    *   `originUrl` is intended to be the base URL where the widget app is hosted (used when setting `iframe.src` and as the `postMessage` target).
    *   Example: if the script src is `https://example.com/widgets/loaderScript.js?orgId=abc`, `originUrl` becomes `https://example.com/widgets/`.
5.  **`checkOrgId(orgId)` — validates orgId and wires message handling**
    *   Throws an error if `orgId` falsy.
    *   Adds a `window.addEventListener('message', ...)` to receive messages from the iframe. Handler:
        *   Parses `event.data` (handles stringified JSON and object).
        *   If `data.type === 'invalidOrg'`, hides the iframe.
        *   If `data.type === 'dimensions'`, reads `payload.width/height` and sets `iframeStyle.width/height`.
        *   If `data.type === 'setParentStyle'` or `resetParentStyle`, it toggles `document.body` overflow between `"hidden"` and `"initial"` and also tries to toggle overflow on `firstElement` (first DIV in the body) and an element with id `root`. This is used when the iframe wants to disable page scrolling while open.
        *   `floatingWidgetStyle` and `resetFloatingWidgetStyle` switch the iframe between compact floating mode and normal size.
        *   `changeFloatingWidgetWidth` accepts a payload with a new width.
    *   Adds `iframe.addEventListener('load', () => iframeStyle.display = "block")` so the iframe becomes visible when it finishes loading.
    *   Sets `iframe.src =` ${originUrl}?orgId=${orgId}&url=${url}\`\` — this loads the remote widget with orgId and page URL as query params.
6.  **Window resize handling**
    *   Adds a `resize` listener that updates local `width`/`height` and sends a message to the iframe:
        ```js
        iframe.contentWindow.postMessage(JSON.stringify({
            type: "windowSize",
            payload: { width, height }
        }), originUrl);
        ```
    *   This tells the embedded app about viewport changes.
7.  **Extract `orgId` from the script tag and call `checkOrgId`**
    ```js
    const orgId = script.getAttribute("src")
        .split("?")
        .find((param) => param.includes("orgId"))
        .split("=")[1];
    checkOrgId(orgId);
    ```
    *   The expectation: the script tag includes `?orgId=...` in its `src`.
    *   If extraction fails, it falls into `catch` and logs the error.
8.  **Append `iframe` to `document.body`**
    ```js
    document.body.appendChild(iframe);
    ```

* * *

Boot logic: wait for document ready
-----------------------------------

Finally the IIFE checks `document.readyState`. If the document is already `complete` it calls `loadWidget()` immediately; otherwise it listens for `readystatechange` and calls `loadWidget()` once `document.readyState === "complete"`.

* * *

Summary of runtime behavior / usage
===================================

*   To use this script you include a `<script src="https://host/path/loaderScript.js?orgId=YOUR_ORG"></script>` on a page.
*   When the page loads, the script will:
    *   Build an iframe pointing to `https://host/path/?orgId=YOUR_ORG&url=<page-or-referrer>`.
    *   Append it to the page and show it when the iframe finishes loading.
    *   Listen for `postMessage` messages from the iframe to change dimensions, change parent overflow, toggle floating style, or hide if the org is invalid.
    *   Send `windowSize` messages to the iframe on window resize.

* * *

Bugs / gotchas / security issues and suggested fixes
====================================================

1.  **Unused `widget` element**
    *   The `widget` `<div>` is created and styled but never appended. Remove it or append it intentionally if needed.
2.  **Typos & CSS values**
    *   `iframeStyle.boxSizing = "borderBox";` should be `"border-box"`.
    *   `iframeStyle.right = 0;` and `iframeStyle.bottom = 0;` are valid (0 is allowed), but `"0px"` is clearer and consistent with other values.
3.  **`originUrl` and `postMessage` target origin**
    *   `originUrl` is derived via `.split(scriptName)[0]`. That might include a path (e.g. `https://host/path/`) rather than an origin (`https://host`). For `postMessage`, it’s safer to pass the origin only:
        ```js
        const origin = new URL(script.src).origin;
        iframe.contentWindow.postMessage(message, origin);
        ```
    *   Also validate `event.origin` inside `message` handler to accept messages only from the expected origin.
4.  **Parsing `orgId` fragility**
    *   The code extracts `orgId` by string-splitting. Use `URL`/`URLSearchParams` reliably:
        ```js
        const params = new URL(script.src, location.href).searchParams;
        const orgId = params.get('orgId');
        ```
    *   This avoids exceptions and edge cases.
5.  **Cross-origin parent access risk**
    *   `window.location !== window.parent.location` may throw if `window.parent` is cross-origin (accessing `window.parent.location` may cause a cross-origin error). Safer check:
        ```js
        const inIframe = window.self !== window.top;
        const url = inIframe ? document.referrer : location.href;
        ```
6.  **No origin check in `message` handler**
    *   The handler parses `event.data` without verifying `event.origin`. That can allow any window to send messages to your host page and trigger style changes. Always check `if (event.origin !== expectedOrigin) return;` before trusting `event.data`.
7.  **Parsing `event.data` may throw**
    *   The code `JSON.parse(event.data)` if it's a string — wrap in try/catch to avoid breaking the handler when non-JSON arrives.
8.  **Initial display handling**
    *   `iframeStyle.display` is not initially set to `'none'`, so the iframe might flash before `load`. If you want it hidden until load or until valid org, set `iframeStyle.display = 'none'` before setting `iframe.src` and then show on `load`.
9.  **Potential race: posting `windowSize` before iframe ready**
    *   `postMessage` to `iframe.contentWindow` is fine before `load` — but the remote side might ignore messages until ready. Consider queuing or only posting after the iframe signals readiness (via an `init` message).
10.  **No CSP / sandbox attributes**
    *   Consider using `iframe.setAttribute('sandbox', 'allow-scripts allow-same-origin')` and/or setting `referrerpolicy` if needed for security.

* * *

Quick recommended minimal fixes (code)
======================================

A few edits that improve robustness (not full patch, just highlights):

```js
const script = document.currentScript;
const scriptUrl = new URL(script.src, location.href);
const origin = scriptUrl.origin;
const params = scriptUrl.searchParams;
const orgId = params.get('orgId');

const inIframe = window.self !== window.top;
const pageUrl = inIframe ? document.referrer : location.href;

iframe.style.display = 'none';                   // hide until loaded
iframe.src = `${origin}${scriptUrl.pathname.replace('/loaderScript.js','/')}?orgId=${orgId}&url=${encodeURIComponent(pageUrl)}`;

// in message handler:
if (event.origin !== origin) return;             // trust only expected origin
let data;
try { data = typeof event.data === 'string' ? JSON.parse(event.data) : event.data; }
catch (err) { return; }
```

* * *

If you want, I can:

*   produce a corrected/cleaned version of this loader with the fixes above;
*   or show a minimal example HTML that loads it and a small demo page for the iframe side that sends the messages this loader expects.

Which would you prefer?

## Prompt:
Sets \`iframe.src =\` ${originUrl}?orgId=${orgId}&url=${url}\\\`\\\` — this loads the remote widget with orgId and page URL as query params.

What will this src be equal to if I'm loading from this script: <script src="https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/loaderScript.js?orgId=2" type="text/javascript" crossOrigin="anonymous" async="true" defer="true"></script>

## Response:
Thought for 10s

Short answer:  
`iframe.src` will be

```
https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/?orgId=2&url=<page-URL>
```

Why:

*   `originUrl` is computed as `script.getAttribute("src").split(scriptName)[0]`.  
    With your tag `src="https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/loaderScript.js?orgId=2"` that yields `"https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/"`.
*   `orgId` is extracted as `"2"` from the `?orgId=2` query param.
*   `url` is set to `document.location` when the page is top-level, or `document.referrer` if the page is inside another frame. When converted to a string it becomes the full page URL (e.g. `https://example.com/path`).

Examples:

*   If the host page is `https://example.com/page`, `iframe.src` becomes  
    `https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/?orgId=2&url=https://example.com/page`
*   If the page is embedded in an iframe and the referrer is `https://parent.com/`, `iframe.src` becomes  
    `https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/?orgId=2&url=https://parent.com/`

A couple of important notes:

*   The code does **not** call `encodeURIComponent` on the page URL, so query strings, `#hash`, or special characters will be included raw. It’s safer to encode the URL before appending.
*   `async`, `defer`, and `crossOrigin` on the `<script>` tag don’t change how the `iframe.src` string is built.

## Prompt:
does this mean that the actual logic of the widget is implemented on https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/ not on the loaderScript.js itself?

## Response:
Thought for 6s

Yes — **the widget’s actual UI & behaviour run on `https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/`**, not inside `loaderScript.js`.

### Why (short)

*   `loaderScript.js` only **creates** an `<iframe>` whose `src` is `https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/?orgId=2&url=...`.
*   The iframe then **loads the remote app** from that URL — that remote app is where the chat UI, business logic, network calls, and event handling live.

### What the loader _does_ (on the host page)

*   Builds and styles the `<iframe>` and appends it to `document.body`.
*   Reads the `orgId` from the script `src` and includes it in the iframe URL.
*   Sends `postMessage` messages (e.g. `windowSize`) to the iframe on resize.
*   Listens for `postMessage` messages from the iframe to change parent styles, resize the iframe, hide it on invalid org, toggle floating appearance, etc.
*   Controls visibility (shows the iframe on its `load` event).

### What the loader _cannot_ do (and why it delegates logic to the iframe)

*   Because the iframe content is (likely) cross-origin, the loader **cannot access the iframe DOM or run its code directly** — it can only communicate via `postMessage`. That forces the widget implementation to live in the iframe origin.

### Security / robustness notes (important)

*   The loader’s message handler **does not check `event.origin`**, so a malicious frame/window could potentially send messages that change page styles. You should verify `event.origin` matches the widget origin before acting on messages.
*   The loader appends the page URL raw to the iframe `src` (no `encodeURIComponent`), which can break query parsing.
*   Consider adding `iframe.sandbox`, a proper `targetOrigin` for `postMessage` (use `new URL(script.src).origin`), and origin checks in the message handler.

### Quick ways to confirm yourself

1.  Open DevTools → Network → reload page and watch the request to  
    `https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/?orgId=2&url=...` — that response is the widget app.
2.  Right-click the iframe → Open in new tab — you’ll load the remote widget directly (if it allows being framed).
3.  Console: inspect `document.getElementById('meetusvr-chat-widget').src` to see the exact URL being loaded.

If you want, I can:

*   show a tiny hardened version of the loader that checks `event.origin` and encodes the URL, or
*   write a quick demo page that demonstrates the `postMessage` handshake between host and widget. Which would you prefer?

Now I want you to explain to me this script which I made eariler, also in detail and tell me what are the differences between my script and the chat script. then tell me the steps I need to do in order to migrate the logic and the hardcoded urls and the ui to some place in the backend like they did in the chat while making sure that the widget still works fine.

## Response:

Great — I read your loader (`loyalty-wallet-widget.1.js`) and compared it to the chat loader you showed earlier. I’ll:

1.  Explain your script in detail (what each part does).
2.  Point out the concrete differences between your script and the chat script.
3.  Give a step-by-step migration plan (how to move UI/logic/URLs to a backend-hosted widget while keeping the widget working), plus code examples and security recommendations.

Where I quote or describe your actual code I’ll cite your uploaded file.

1) Detailed explanation of **your** script (high level → line items)
====================================================================

Summary: your loader builds an iframe and loads _inline HTML_ (a blob URL) into it. That HTML contains the entire UI (Loyalty Wallet), JS logic for authentication, token storage, and QR generation calls to hardcoded backend APIs. The parent page and iframe communicate via `postMessage` for token exchange and UI control. Key parts:

*   Top-level constants & sizing:
    *   `scriptName = "loyalty-wallet-widget.1.js"`, `height`/`width` initialized from `window`.
*   IIFE that runs on load and calls `loadWidget()` once `document.readyState === "complete"`.
*   `loadWidget()`:
    *   Creates `<iframe id="loyalty-wallet-widget">` and sets inline styles (position fixed, bottom/right, width/height, borderRadius, boxShadow, `display: none` initially).
        loyalty-wallet-widget.1
    *   Defines `messageTypes` (more types than the chat loader — you added `generateQR`, `qrGenerated`, `requestToken`, `setToken`, `error`, `requestToken`, etc.).
        loyalty-wallet-widget.1
    *   Defines `originUrl` from `script.src` (via `.split(scriptName)[0]`) and two hardcoded API base URLs:
        *   `nasnavApi = "https://api.dev.meetusvr.com/"`
        *   `yeshteryApi = "https://api-yeshtery.dev.meetusvr.com/v1/"`.
            loyalty-wallet-widget.1
    *   `checkOrgId(orgId)` — main flow if orgId present:
        *   **Generates the entire widget HTML** (string) — includes CSS, UI markup, and inlined `<script>` that:
            *   manages `currentToken`, tries to read token from `localStorage`,
            *   defines `authenticate()` that calls `${yeshteryApi}yeshtery/token` with hardcoded credentials (`test_user@yopmail.com`, `abc12345`), saves token in `localStorage` and uses it to enable buttons, etc.,
            *   defines `generateQR(type)` which calls `${nasnavApi}wallet/<type>/qrCode` with `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` and converts blob to image URL,
            *   listens for `postMessage` from parent to receive `setToken` message,
            *   posts `requestToken` to parent on load.
                loyalty-wallet-widget.1
        *   Creates a `Blob` from that HTML and sets `iframe.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)` (so the iframe loads the inlined app).
            loyalty-wallet-widget.1
        *   Adds `window.addEventListener("message", ...)` in the parent loader to:
            *   parse incoming messages (tries `JSON.parse` if string),
            *   handle messages like `invalidOrg`, `dimensions`, and also `requestToken` — when iframe asks, parent looks up `localStorage` tokens and replies with `postMessage({ type: 'setToken', token })` to the iframe (using `targetOrigin = '*'`).
                loyalty-wallet-widget.1
        *   On iframe `load` the parent shows the iframe (`display = block`) and requests a token (sends `requestToken` after 100ms).
            loyalty-wallet-widget.1
    *   Window resize listener sends `windowSize` messages to iframe (target `' * '`).
        loyalty-wallet-widget.1
    *   Extracts `orgId` from `script.src` using string splitting and calls `checkOrgId(orgId)`. If extraction fails, logs error.
        loyalty-wallet-widget.1
    *   Finally it appends the iframe to `document.body` (some defensive logic to append existing element or the created iframe).
        loyalty-wallet-widget.1

Important runtime behaviors & consequences:

*   The widget UI & logic are bundled into the loader and loaded into the iframe via a blob URL (so the iframe content is effectively _same-origin_ with the parent). That allows direct access to `iframe.contentWindow` and easier direct messaging.
*   The loader and the widget use `postMessage` but **use `'*'` as target origin** when posting and do **not check `event.origin`**, so messages are accepted from any origin. (Security risk.)
*   You hardcoded backend API endpoints and even credentials in the widget HTML (the inlined script calls the token endpoint with hardcoded credentials). That is a major security and maintenance issue.
*   The parent responds to `requestToken` by reading localStorage from the parent page and sending it to the iframe. This allows token reuse across page and widget.

2) Main differences between **your** script and the chat script you posted earlier
==================================================================================

I’ll list the key differences and implications.

1.  **Where the UI & logic live**
    *   **Chat loader (earlier)**: only builds an `<iframe>` whose `src` points to a remote host (e.g. `https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/?orgId=2&url=...`). All UI and business logic are served from that remote origin (cross-origin iframe).  
        _Implication:_ updates live centrally; widget code is not shipped in every page; cross-origin limits access between host and widget; communication is forced to `postMessage`.
    *   **Your loader**: builds the entire UI as an HTML string inside the loader, then creates a **Blob URL** and sets the iframe to that blob. The UI/logic are embedded in the loader itself.
        loyalty-wallet-widget.1
        _Implication:_ widget delivered inline to every page, loader larger, easier to access iframe DOM (same-origin), but harder to update centrally and risk of exposing secrets.
2.  **Hardcoded backend URLs & credentials**
    *   **Chat loader**: does **not** include API calls or credentials — it defers those to the remote widget running on the widget host.
    *   **Your loader**: contains `nasnavApi` and `yeshteryApi` hardcoded, plus an **authentication call with hardcoded credentials** in the inlined widget script.
        loyalty-wallet-widget.1
        _Implication:_ credentials are visible to anyone who downloads the script; rotating or changing endpoints requires changing loader script across clients.
3.  **Origin & security**
    *   **Chat loader**: remote cross-origin iframe — intended to use `postMessage` with explicit origin checking. The chat loader as provided lacked strict origin checks, but its design relies on a remote endpoint.
    *   **Your loader**: uses blob URL -> same-origin iframe (iframe inherits parent origin) and uses `postMessage` with `*`. No checks on incoming messages. Because same-origin, the parent could access iframe DOM if needed.
        loyalty-wallet-widget.1
4.  **Features / message types**
    *   **Chat loader**: had message types for resizing, floating, parent style toggles.
    *   **Your loader**: includes all chat types **plus** loyalty-specific ones: `generateQR`, `qrGenerated`, `requestToken`, `setToken`, `error`. You also added logic for sending `requestToken` and the parent replying with a `setToken`.
        loyalty-wallet-widget.1
5.  **Token handling**
    *   **Chat loader**: expected the remote widget to drive auth and manage tokens (or pass through via `postMessage`) because widget runs remotely.
    *   **Your loader**: widget tries to authenticate itself using hardcoded credentials, stores tokens in localStorage, and also asks parent for tokens via `requestToken` to support sharing tokens between host and widget.
        loyalty-wallet-widget.1
6.  **Deployment & update model**
    *   **Chat loader**: central hosting makes updates painless (change remote app, all clients get update).
    *   **Your loader**: must re-deploy the loader script to update UI/logic or change endpoints for every client that embeds it.

* * *

3) Migration plan — move UI/logic/URLs to backend (so widget behaves like chat loader)
======================================================================================

Goal: move UI and logic out of the loader and host them in a backend (or static hosting) so you have centralized control, remove hardcoded credentials from client, and keep a small loader that only does: create iframe, set src to your hosted widget, and manage secured `postMessage` handshake.

I’ll give a step-by-step plan with code snippets and security notes.

* * *

Step A — Decide hosting & origin model
--------------------------------------

Option 1 (recommended): Host the widget static site on a dedicated origin (e.g. `https://widget.dev.meetusvr.com/` or `https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/`). The iframe will load that origin: cross-origin separation.  
Option 2: Host the widget on same origin as API (e.g. `https://app.dev.meetusvr.com/widget/`) — still centrally hosted but cross-origin relative to host pages.

**Why host centrally?**

*   Central updates, secure backend token operations (no client credentials), smaller loader.

* * *

Step B — Backend endpoints to provide
-------------------------------------

Implement these (example routes):

1.  `GET /widget/?orgId=<id>&url=<hostPage>` — serves the widget HTML app (static SPA). This is the URL the loader will point iframe at.
2.  `POST /api/auth` — server-side authentication (if needed). Must never embed credentials in client.
    *   Accepts a client token, or uses server side client credentials to authenticate with identity provider and return a short-lived JWT to widget.
3.  `GET /api/wallet/:type/qr` — protected endpoint that returns QR image (server makes call to `nasnavApi` or your system). Or proxy to existing QR endpoint but keep auth/logic server-side.
4.  `GET /api/config?orgId=...` — returns config (API base urls, branding, feature toggles) for the widget. The loader can pass `orgId` in query and the widget fetches config from this route.

**Server responsibilities**

*   Store and manage any credentials securely (env variables, vault).
*   Issue short-lived tokens (JWTs) to widget or accept an OAuth2 flow depending on your auth scheme.
*   Rate limit and audit requests.

* * *

Step C — Small robust loader script (client-side)
-------------------------------------------------

Replace your current loader contents (that blob-inlines UI) with a compact loader that:

*   Extracts `orgId` safely via `URL`/`URLSearchParams`,
*   Builds `<iframe>` and sets `iframe.src` to your hosted widget URL (include `orgId` and page URL, encoded),
*   Adds `postMessage` handshake with target origin equal to widget origin,
*   Performs origin checks on inbound messages,
*   Requests token from host page storage only if you want that behavior (but prefer server-side token flows).

Example improved loader (drop-in):

```js
// loaderScript.fixed.js
(() => {
  const script = document.currentScript;
  const scriptUrl = new URL(script.src, location.href);
  const scriptParams = scriptUrl.searchParams;
  const orgId = scriptParams.get('orgId');
  if (!orgId) {
    console.error('orgId required');
    return;
  }

  const widgetOrigin = 'https://widget.dev.meetusvr.com'; // where widget will be hosted
  const widgetPath = '/'; // or '/widget/'
  const pageUrl = (window.self !== window.top) ? document.referrer : location.href;

  const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
  iframe.id = 'loyalty-wallet-widget';
  Object.assign(iframe.style, {
    position: 'fixed', right: '20px', bottom: '20px',
    width: '350px', height: '500px', border: '0', zIndex: '999999',
    borderRadius: '12px', boxShadow: '0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)',
    display: 'none',
  });
  iframe.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'true');
  iframe.setAttribute('referrerpolicy', 'no-referrer');
  iframe.setAttribute('sandbox', 'allow-scripts allow-same-origin'); // tune as needed

  // Build iframe src (encode URL)
  const src = `${widgetOrigin}${widgetPath}?orgId=${encodeURIComponent(orgId)}&url=${encodeURIComponent(pageUrl)}`;
  iframe.src = src;

  // Message handling with origin check
  window.addEventListener('message', (ev) => {
    if (ev.origin !== widgetOrigin) return; // only trust widget origin
    const data = typeof ev.data === 'string' ? JSON.parse(ev.data) : ev.data;
    // handle data.type safely (dimensions, setParentStyle, requestToken etc.)
  });

  iframe.addEventListener('load', () => {
    iframe.style.display = 'block';
    // optional: request widget to init handshake
    iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({ type: 'init', payload: { width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight } }, widgetOrigin);
  });

  document.body.appendChild(iframe);
})();
```

Notes:

*   Use `widgetOrigin` as the only allowed origin for `postMessage` and `ev.origin` checks.
*   Do not use `'*'` as postMessage target for security-sensitive messages.

* * *

Step D — Move UI & logic into the hosted widget app
---------------------------------------------------

Create a small SPA (React/Vue/plain HTML+JS) that lives at `https://widget.dev.meetusvr.com/`. Responsibilities:

*   Render the Loyalty Wallet UI (your current HTML/CSS).
*   On load, call `GET /api/config?orgId=...` to get configuration (API base URLs, feature flags).
*   Use a secure server-side auth flow:
    *   Option A: widget calls `POST /api/auth/session` which returns a short-lived token that’s issued by your backend (backend uses stored credentials to call identity provider).
    *   Option B: widget uses OAuth2 redirect or PKCE flow if authenticating end-users.
*   For QR generation, widget calls `GET /api/wallet/:type/qr` on your backend (backend proxies to `nasnavApi` or handles QR creation).
*   Communicate with parent via `postMessage` limited to known messages (e.g., `requestParentToken` allowed only from parent origin if you decide to support host-provided tokens).
*   Avoid storing long-lived secrets on the client. Use short-lived tokens and refresh via backend.

* * *

Step E — Replace hardcoded endpoints & credentials
--------------------------------------------------

*   Remove `nasnavApi` and `yeshteryApi` from client code. Keep those URLs and any credentials in backend config (env vars or secrets manager).
*   Backend calls external services as needed. The client only calls your backend endpoints.

* * *

Step F — Token handling designs (pick one)
------------------------------------------

1.  **Server-side token & proxy (recommended for system tokens)**
    *   Client requests QR from your endpoint: `GET /api/wallet/google/qr` with user proof (session).
    *   Backend uses stored service credentials, fetches QR from `nasnavApi`, and returns blob to client.
    *   Advantage: client never sees service credentials.
2.  **Short-lived token issued by backend to client (for user sessions)**
    *   Backend does authentication or token issuance using safe flows, then returns token to widget (short TTL).
    *   Widget uses it to call protected backend routes.
    *   Backend can revoke or rotate tokens easily.
3.  **Parent-hosted token (optional)**
    *   If the host page already has user tokens and you want the widget to reuse them, create a _secure handshake_:
        *   Parent loader checks domain match / config, then sends token to widget via `postMessage` but with explicit `targetOrigin` set to your widget origin.
        *   Parent verifies the widget origin before sending.
    *   _Caveat:_ this shares token with the widget and should only be done when both app owners trust each other.

* * *

Step G — Security hardening checklist
-------------------------------------

*   Use `new URL(script.src)` and `URLSearchParams` for parsing `orgId` (avoid brittle `.split()` logic).
*   In loader: only `postMessage` to `widgetOrigin`; in `message` handler accept messages only if `ev.origin === widgetOrigin`.
*   Use `iframe` `sandbox` attribute to limit capabilities. Add only the needed `allow-*` flags.
*   Do **not** put credentials in client JS nor in HTML blobs.
*   Use HTTPS on all endpoints.
*   Add CORS properly on backend endpoints and limit allowed origins.
*   Consider CSP headers for widget host.
*   Rate-limit sensitive endpoints & add monitoring/auditing.

* * *

Step H — Staged rollout & testing plan
--------------------------------------

1.  **Develop widget app** locally and host on a staging origin: `https://widget-staging.example.com/`.
2.  **Update loader** to point to staging widget origin; deploy loader to staging pages.
3.  **Manual tests:**
    *   Open host page and verify widget loads from remote origin (no blob).
    *   Network tab: verify `widgetOrigin/?orgId=...` loads HTML/JS assets.
    *   Verify `postMessage` handshake only allows expected origins.
    *   Generate QR: verify request goes to your backend proxy endpoint and not directly to nasnav/yeshtery from client.
    *   Verify token flows: no secrets in client.
4.  **Security review**: check for tokens in localStorage, logs, and network. Ensure tokens are short lived and endpoints require auth.
5.  **Smoke tests** and A/B deploy to subset, then full rollout.

* * *

Code examples — minimal server proxy (Node/Express pseudo)
----------------------------------------------------------

```js
// server.js (very simplified)
const express = require('express');
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/config', (req, res) => {
  const orgId = req.query.orgId;
  // return config for org (branding, QR types allowed, etc.)
  res.json({ nasnavApi: 'https://api.dev.meetusvr.com/', qrsEnabled: true });
});

app.post('/api/auth/session', async (req, res) => {
  // server-side: call identity provider or upstream token endpoint using secure creds
  const tokenResp = await fetch('https://auth-upstream/yeshtery/token', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers:{ 'Content-Type':'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ /* server-side creds from env */ })
  });
  const data = await tokenResp.json();
  // create your own short-lived JWT or return the upstream token
  res.json({ token: data.accessToken });
});

app.get('/api/wallet/:type/qr', async (req, res) => {
  // accept Authorization header from widget if needed
  const qrResp = await fetch(`https://api.dev.meetusvr.com/wallet/${req.params.type}/qrCode`, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.SERVICE_TOKEN}` },
  });
  const buf = await qrResp.buffer();
  res.set('Content-Type', 'image/png');
  res.send(buf);
});

app.use(express.static('widget-build')); // serves the widget SPA at / (GET /?orgId=..)
```

* * *

Migration checklist (practical, prioritized)
--------------------------------------------

1.  **Create hosted widget app** (move inline HTML/CSS/JS into a proper SPA).
2.  **Implement backend endpoints** (`/api/config`, `/api/auth/session`, `/api/wallet/:type/qr`) and secure them (env vars, HTTPS).
3.  **Replace loader blob logic**: update loader to point iframe to your hosted widget origin. Use `encodeURIComponent` for the `url` query.
4.  **Remove hardcoded endpoints/creds** from client — use backend.
5.  **Implement secure `postMessage` handshake** (only accept messages from widget origin).
6.  **Add sandbox & referrerpolicy** attributes on iframe.
7.  **Test thoroughly** on staging, do security review, then roll to production.
8.  **Deprecate old loader** and remove inline code from CDN (or keep as fallback for older integrations during a transition window).

* * *

Quick answers to likely questions / pitfalls
============================================

*   **Will token sharing via parent still work?** — Yes, but do it securely: parent should only `postMessage` tokens to `widgetOrigin` and the widget should verify `event.origin`. Prefer to let widget get tokens from backend instead of parent-provided tokens unless necessary.
*   **Why not embed credentials in loader?** — Anyone can download the loader; credentials leak immediately.
*   **Do I have to move UI code entirely?** — No, you can initially host the same HTML as a static file and point iframe to it, then iteratively replace functionality with API-backed calls.

* * *

If you want, I can:

*   produce a **drop-in replacement loader** (full code) that points to a widget origin and includes hardened checks;
*   scaffold the **server endpoints** (Express or similar) for token and QR proxy with code you can run; or
*   convert your current inline widget HTML into a small static SPA file and show where to host it.

Which of those should I generate now?

## Prompt:
\*\*Chat loader (earlier)\*\*: only builds an \`<iframe>\` whose \`src\` points to a remote host (e.g. \`https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/?orgId=2&url=...\`). All UI and business logic are served from that remote origin (cross-origin iframe).

can't I access this logic by typing this link?

## Response:
Thought for 12s

Short answer: yes — you can open that `https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/?orgId=2&url=...` link in your browser and see the widget app, but there are important limits on what you can actually **access** and **do** with it. Below I’ll explain exactly what happens when you open it, what you _can_ inspect, what you _cannot_ access, and quick steps to investigate it safely.

* * *

What happens if you open that URL in a browser
==============================================

*   The remote host (`webchat.dev.meetusvr.com`) will serve the widget app (HTML/CSS/JS). You’ll see the UI exactly as the iframe would render it.
*   The page will receive the query params (`orgId=2&url=...`) and can use them to configure itself.

What you can inspect / do
=========================

1.  **Open it in a tab**
    *   Right-click the iframe → _Open in new tab_ (or paste the URL in the address bar). The widget will run as its own top-level page.
2.  **View client-side source & assets**
    *   Browser DevTools → Sources: you can view (and pretty-print) any JavaScript/CSS/HTML the server sends. Bundles may be minified, but they are still downloadable and readable.
    *   Network tab: see every network request the widget makes (API endpoints, images, scripts). That reveals the REST endpoints it calls and the request/response shapes (subject to CORS / auth).
3.  **Interact with the UI**
    *   You can click buttons, trigger flows, and watch requests and console output.
4.  **Request assets directly (curl/wget)**
    *   You can `curl` the page or specific files to fetch the HTML or JS (useful for automation or quick inspection).

What you cannot access (or shouldn’t expect to)
===============================================

1.  **You cannot see server-side code**
    *   Any backend logic (database queries, credentials, business logic executed on the server, private API implementations) is not exposed by opening the page. You only see what the server sends to the client and what client-side JS does.
2.  **You cannot reach into the iframe from a different origin**
    *   If you embed that widget as an `<iframe>` on `https://your-site.com`, the browser’s **same-origin policy** prevents your page from reading or manipulating the iframe DOM or JS (e.g., `iframe.contentWindow.document`) because origins differ (`your-site.com` ≠ `webchat.dev.meetusvr.com`). Communication must use `window.postMessage()`.
3.  **You may not be able to reproduce embed-only behaviors**
    *   The widget might behave differently when top-level vs framed (it could check `window.self !== window.top` and change behavior, or rely on `document.referrer`). So opening the URL directly might skip some embed-specific flows.
4.  **Authenticated/protected endpoints may block you**
    *   Many API calls require tokens/Cookies. If you don’t have valid credentials, network requests will fail or return 401/403. You can still see the endpoints being called and the shape of the requests, but you won’t be able to call protected APIs successfully without credentials.

Security / privacy notes
========================

*   If the widget includes secrets or credentials in client JS (bad practice), you’ll find them when you inspect the source. That’s why sensitive logic and secrets must be moved to server-side code.
*   If you open the widget page locally and it stores tokens in `localStorage` or cookies, those will be isolated to the widget origin (not shared with your host pages unless intentionally proxied).

Quick step-by-step: how to inspect it now
=========================================

1.  Paste the widget URL in the address bar and open it.
2.  Open DevTools (F12):
    *   **Network**: reload and watch all requests (JS bundles, API calls, images).
    *   **Sources**: find scripts, click “Pretty print” (`{}`) to read minified JS.
    *   **Console**: see logs and errors.
3.  If you want raw HTML or JS:
    *   `curl -i 'https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/?orgId=2&url=https://example.com'`
    *   Or fetch any JS file you saw in Network: `curl 'https://webchat.dev.meetusvr.com/static/js/main.xxxx.js'`
4.  To test embed behavior: create a simple local HTML that embeds the widget in an iframe and observe `postMessage` exchanges in DevTools.

Summary — final answer in one line
==================================

Yes — you can open the widget link and see / inspect the **client-side** app and its network calls, but you **cannot** access any server-side logic or directly manipulate the iframe’s internals when it’s embedded on a different origin; cross-origin communication must use `postMessage` and protected APIs still require proper authentication.

* * *

If you want, I can:

*   show the exact DevTools steps with screenshots (walkthrough), or
*   give curl commands to fetch the page and the main JS bundle so you can inspect them, or
*   check whether that specific widget responds differently when framed vs opened directly (I can give you a small local HTML snippet to test). Which would be most helpful?

## Prompt:
so I should make the script call another link and deploy the logic, ui on backend project or can I deploy it on frontend project too?

## Response:
Good question 👌 — the short answer is:

👉 **Yes, you should move the logic + UI out of the loader script and serve them from a hosted app (a URL that your loader’s iframe will point to).**  
That app can be deployed as either:

1.  **Backend project (server-rendered or API + static files)**
    *   Example: a Node/Express, Django, Spring Boot project.
    *   The server both **serves the widget static assets (HTML/JS/CSS)** _and_ provides API endpoints (`/auth`, `/wallet/qr`, etc.).
    *   Advantages: one project handles UI + secure backend logic; credentials and API keys stay server-side.
    *   Disadvantage: heavier to deploy if you just need static UI.
2.  **Frontend project (static site)**
    *   Example: a React/Vue app built and deployed to Netlify, Vercel, or as static files on Nginx/S3/CloudFront.
    *   The loader iframe would point to that static app (e.g. `https://widget.example.com/?orgId=...&url=...`).
    *   The widget app then calls your backend APIs for QR/token logic.
    *   Advantages: separation of concerns (frontend is just UI, backend is just APIs), very easy to update UI.
    *   Disadvantage: you must already have a backend API available; the frontend cannot securely hold secrets or system credentials.

* * *

### Recommended setup (best practice)

*   **Frontend widget app**: deploy your Loyalty Wallet UI as a standalone frontend project (React/Vue/Vanilla JS) at `https://widget.example.com`.
*   **Backend project**: expose APIs for auth, QR generation, token handling, etc. — the frontend widget app calls these APIs.
*   **Loader script**: very small, just creates an iframe and points to `https://widget.example.com/?orgId=...&url=...`.

This way:

*   UI is easy to update without touching the loader.
*   Backend logic is centralized and secure.
*   No hardcoded credentials in client code.

✅ **So yes, you can deploy the widget app on a frontend project**, but any sensitive logic (auth, API keys, QR generation with secrets) must live in a **backend**. The widget frontend should only call your backend’s APIs.

* * *

Would you like me to draft a **minimal project structure** (frontend + backend) showing how to split the code you have now between them? That way you’d have a clear blueprint of what moves where.

## Prompt:
Alright explain the reason why we are going to create a second version of the loyalty wallet script and what's the idea behind the second script (flow) and why is it safer and how we're going to avoid hardcoded urls

## Response:
Perfect — let’s lay this out clearly. Right now you have **version 1** of the Loyalty Wallet loader (`loyalty-wallet-widget.1.js`), and we’re planning a **second version**. Here’s why and what changes.

* * *

1\. Why create a second version of the loader?
==============================================

*   **Version 1 problems:**
    *   **UI + business logic are bundled directly in the loader** (via blob HTML). That makes the loader huge and hard to update — every client must replace the script to get new UI.
    *   **Hardcoded URLs and credentials** inside the loader mean anyone can see them in browser DevTools. That’s a big security issue.
    *   **All logic runs on the client side**, so if APIs or flows change, you must redeploy the loader to every integration.
    *   **No origin checks in `postMessage`**, which means anyone can send malicious messages to the widget.
*   **Creating a second version** means we don’t break the old integrations immediately (backward compatibility), while moving to a **cleaner, safer, centrally hosted approach**.

* * *

2\. What’s the idea behind the second script? (the flow)
========================================================

**Flow of Version 2 (inspired by the chat loader):**

1.  **Loader script is tiny.**
    *   Its only job is to create an `<iframe>` and point it to a URL (your hosted widget app).
    *   It passes in `orgId` and the host page URL as query parameters.
2.  **Iframe loads the widget app from a central server.**
    *   This is where the **UI (HTML/CSS/JS)** lives.
    *   The widget app is a standalone frontend (React/Vue or plain JS).
    *   Because it’s centrally hosted, updating UI means you deploy once, and all clients get the update.
3.  **Widget app communicates with your backend APIs.**
    *   For example:
        *   `GET /api/config?orgId=123` → returns org-specific settings.
        *   `POST /api/auth/session` → widget gets a short-lived token.
        *   `GET /api/wallet/:type/qr` → backend generates QR and returns it.
    *   The backend hides all secrets and only exposes safe endpoints to the widget.
4.  **Loader ↔ Widget communication via `postMessage`.**
    *   Loader listens for messages from the iframe (`dimensions`, `requestToken`, etc.) but validates `event.origin`.
    *   Loader only `postMessage`s back to the iframe using its exact origin (no `'*'`).

* * *

3\. Why is this safer?
======================

*   **Secrets never exposed**:
    *   Hardcoded credentials and backend API URLs are moved into server-side code.
    *   The widget frontend only calls your backend (not third-party APIs directly).
    *   Even if someone downloads the loader, they can’t see your service credentials.
*   **Centralized updates**:
    *   You patch the widget app once on the backend → all host pages immediately use the latest version.
    *   No need to ask every client to update their `<script>` tag.
*   **Cross-origin sandbox**:
    *   The iframe runs on its own domain (`widget.example.com`), isolated from the host page.
    *   This protects host pages from widget bugs and protects the widget from host tampering.
*   **Strict origin checks**:
    *   Loader will only trust messages from `https://widget.example.com`.
    *   No more open `postMessage` to/from `'*'`, which could be exploited.
*   **Cleaner separation of concerns**:
    *   Loader = lightweight injector.
    *   Widget frontend = UI.
    *   Backend = logic, tokens, API proxy.

* * *

4\. How we avoid hardcoded URLs
===============================

In **Version 2**, we replace hardcoded API base URLs like:

```js
const nasnavApi = "https://api.dev.meetusvr.com/";
const yeshteryApi = "https://api-yeshtery.dev.meetusvr.com/v1/";
```

with a **dynamic configuration flow**:

1.  Loader iframe URL includes only `orgId` and host page `url`:
    ```
    https://widget.example.com/?orgId=123&url=https://host.com/page
    ```
2.  Widget frontend calls your backend for config:
    ```js
    fetch(`/api/config?orgId=123`)
       .then(r => r.json())
       .then(config => {
          // config.nasnavApi, config.qrEnabled, branding, etc.
       });
    ```
3.  Backend decides which API endpoints to expose for that org.
    *   If tomorrow the base URL changes (e.g. from `api.dev.meetusvr.com` → `api.prod.meetusvr.com`), you just update the backend config, not the loader.

So: **all URLs become backend-managed, not hardcoded client-side**.

* * *

✅ Summary (one-liner for stakeholders)
======================================

We’re building **Version 2** of the Loyalty Wallet loader to split responsibilities: loader only injects an iframe, widget UI is centrally hosted, and sensitive logic moves to the backend. This makes the widget **safer (no exposed secrets, strict origin checks)**, **easier to update (central hosting)**, and **more flexible (no hardcoded URLs)**.

* * *

Do you want me to **draw a simple diagram** of V1 vs V2 flow (loader–iframe–backend) so you can present this idea visually to your team/manager?

## Prompt:
make it much simpler and concise, I need this explaination for my taiga card

## Response:
Got it 👍 — here’s a concise version you can drop into your Taiga card:

* * *

### Why a second version of the Loyalty Wallet loader?

*   **Current script (V1):**
    *   Contains UI + business logic directly inside the loader.
    *   Hardcoded API URLs and even credentials.
    *   Every update requires replacing the script everywhere.
    *   Open `postMessage` without origin checks → security risk.
*   **New script (V2):**
    *   Loader only creates an iframe and points to a hosted widget app.
    *   Widget UI + logic live centrally (frontend project).
    *   All sensitive URLs and tokens handled by the backend (no hardcoded secrets).
    *   Strict origin checks for `postMessage`.
    *   Updates deployed once on the server → all clients get them instantly.

**Result:** Safer (no exposed secrets), easier to maintain (central hosting), and flexible (no hardcoded URLs).

* * *

Want me to also give you a **one-sentence “acceptance criteria” style** version for the Taiga task description?

## Prompt:
So how to start this

## Response:
Here’s a simple, actionable starting plan you can follow for **Version 2** of the Loyalty Wallet widget:

* * *

### 🚀 Step-by-step to start

1.  **Set up hosting for the widget UI**
    *   Pick where to host:
        *   If just static UI → use a **frontend project** (React, Vue, or plain JS) on Vercel, Netlify, or S3/CloudFront.
        *   If you also need APIs in the same place → host it inside your **backend project**.
    *   Create a new repo/project `loyalty-wallet-widget-frontend`.
2.  **Move the UI & logic out of the loader**
    *   Take the HTML/CSS/JS you currently embed in the loader and move it into this new widget frontend.
    *   Replace direct calls to `nasnavApi`/`yeshteryApi` with calls to **your backend endpoints**.
3.  **Expose backend endpoints**
    *   In your backend, add routes like:
        *   `GET /api/config?orgId=...` → returns org-specific config.
        *   `POST /api/auth/session` → handles token generation securely.
        *   `GET /api/wallet/:type/qr` → returns QR code.
    *   Keep credentials and base URLs in backend **env variables**, not in the client.
4.  **Create the new loader (V2)**
    *   Tiny script (`loaderScript.v2.js`) that:
        *   Extracts `orgId` from the `<script>` tag.
        *   Creates an iframe with `src=https://widget.example.com/?orgId=...&url=...`.
        *   Listens to `postMessage` **only from the widget origin**.
5.  **Test end-to-end locally**
    *   Host page with `<script src="loaderScript.v2.js?orgId=123"></script>`.
    *   Check the iframe loads the hosted widget.
    *   Verify API calls go through your backend, not directly to 3rd-party services.
6.  **Deploy + Rollout**
    *   Deploy the widget frontend and backend APIs.
    *   Share the new `<script>` snippet with teams or replace V1 gradually.

* * *

👉 **In short:**

*   Start with a new widget frontend project.
*   Add backend APIs to handle all secrets.
*   Rewrite the loader to just embed the hosted widget.

* * *

Would you like me to **draft a minimal folder structure** (frontend + backend) so you know exactly where to put what code when you begin?

## Prompt:
I have a react app that uses TypeScript, shadcn, etc. that handles this loyalty wallet widget and has it, and It's deployed on vercel right now, can I point my iframe to this widget in my loaderScript or do I have to copy the logic and ui again to my project which I'm gonna host using different tech stack?

## Response:
Thought for 6s

Short answer: **Yes — point the iframe to your Vercel-hosted React app.** You don’t need to copy the UI/logic into a different stack.  
Below is a concise checklist, pitfalls to watch, and a secure minimal loader snippet you can drop in.

* * *

Why pointing to Vercel works
----------------------------

*   The iframe just loads a URL — your Vercel deployment is a perfectly valid widget origin.
*   Central hosting (Vercel) lets you update the widget once and all embedders get the update instantly.

* * *

Things you must (or should) do before embedding
-----------------------------------------------

1.  **Allow framing**
    *   Ensure the widget responses do **not** send `X-Frame-Options: DENY|SAMEORIGIN`.
    *   Prefer setting a CSP header: `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' https://allowed-host.com;` (or allow all during testing).
    *   On Vercel/Next.js use `headers()` in `next.config.js` or `vercel.json` to set headers.
2.  **Decide how auth/tokens work**
    *   _Do not_ pass credentials in query string.
    *   Use backend flows:
        *   Widget calls your backend `/api/auth` or `/api/config` to get short-lived tokens.
        *   Or have the parent page securely `postMessage` a token to the widget after validating origin (only if you trust the host).
    *   If you rely on cookies, set them with `SameSite=None; Secure` and ensure the backend sets proper CORS.
3.  **Secure postMessage handshake**
    *   Parent should `postMessage(..., widgetOrigin)` and only accept messages where `event.origin === widgetOrigin`.
    *   Do not use `'*'`.
4.  **Pass only safe data in query params**
    *   Send `orgId` and encoded `url` only: `...?orgId=123&url=${encodeURIComponent(location.href)}`.
    *   Don’t pass secrets or tokens via URL.
5.  **Iframe attributes**
    *   Use `sandbox` if you want to restrict capabilities — but be careful: `sandbox` may block scripts or same-origin behavior. Example minimal: `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"` (tune as needed).
    *   Set `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"` if you don’t want the parent URL sent as the Referer header.
6.  **CORS & API endpoints**
    *   Widget frontend will call your backend APIs. Add correct CORS headers and restrict allowed origins.
    *   Backend must proxy/protect access to third-party systems (no secrets in client).
7.  **Test for cookies & storage issues**
    *   If widget expects to reuse cookies from your backend, cross-site cookies require `SameSite=None; Secure`. Test on the target embed domains.

* * *

Minimal secure loader (drop-in)
-------------------------------

```js
(() => {
  const script = document.currentScript;
  const scriptUrl = new URL(script.src, location.href);
  const orgId = scriptUrl.searchParams.get('orgId');
  if (!orgId) {
    console.error('orgId required');
    return;
  }

  const widgetOrigin = 'https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app'; // change to your Vercel URL (no trailing slash)
  const pageUrl = (window.self !== window.top) ? document.referrer : location.href;
  const src = `${widgetOrigin}/?orgId=${encodeURIComponent(orgId)}&url=${encodeURIComponent(pageUrl)}`;

  const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
  iframe.id = 'loyalty-wallet-widget';
  Object.assign(iframe.style, {
    position: 'fixed', right: '20px', bottom: '20px',
    width: '350px', height: '500px', border: '0', zIndex: '999999',
    display: 'none',
  });

  // optional security attributes
  iframe.setAttribute('referrerpolicy', 'no-referrer');
  // tune sandbox carefully; allow-same-origin required if your widget needs same-origin behavior
  iframe.setAttribute('sandbox', 'allow-scripts allow-same-origin');

  iframe.src = src;

  // Only accept messages from the widget origin
  window.addEventListener('message', (ev) => {
    if (ev.origin !== widgetOrigin) return;
    let data;
    try { data = typeof ev.data === 'string' ? JSON.parse(ev.data) : ev.data; }
    catch (e) { return; }
    // handle expected types: dimensions, requestToken, setParentStyle, etc.
  });

  iframe.addEventListener('load', () => {
    iframe.style.display = 'block';
    // optional: initiate handshake
    iframe.contentWindow.postMessage(JSON.stringify({ type: 'init', payload: { width: innerWidth, height: innerHeight }}), widgetOrigin);
  });

  document.body.appendChild(iframe);
})();
```

* * *

Quick test checklist
--------------------

1.  Open the widget URL in a tab — verify UI works.
2.  Embed the loader in a sample host page — confirm no console/CSP/X-Frame errors.
3.  Test `postMessage` handshake and confirm messages have `event.origin === widgetOrigin`.
4.  Test QR/token flows — ensure API calls go to your backend, not exposed endpoints.

* * *

Bottom line
-----------

*   **You can and should point the iframe to your Vercel React app** — no need to copy the UI/logic.
*   Just harden framing headers, decide token flow (backend-issued tokens recommended), enforce `postMessage` origin checks, and avoid passing secrets in URLs.

If you want, I can:

*   produce the exact changes for your Vercel headers (Next.js or vercel.json) to allow framing, or
*   adapt the loader snippet with your actual Vercel URL and desired sandbox/referrer settings — tell me the Vercel domain and I’ll paste the ready-to-use loader.
